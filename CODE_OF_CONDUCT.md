We promise to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community, upholding the balance principles that sustained Ancient Egypt.

## 𓄤 Standards of Conduct

**Behaviors that weave the Necklace of Harmony**:

## 𓉞 Enforcement

Actions will follow Thoth's wisdom:
1. 𓆓 Private warning (Anubis' caution)
2. ⚖️ Temporary suspension (Set's exile)
3. 𓁝 Permanent ban (Apophis' defeat)
